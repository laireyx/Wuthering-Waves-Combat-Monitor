## How it works?

Log file of WW contains a wealth of informations, including life values of the entity parts, allowing us to calculate DPS by tracking them.

## Caveats

- Unfortunately not all monsters have part information. In other words, this approach could not be applied to all situations.
- Scale of the life value fluctuates a lot. Naive comparison between different types of monsters could lead a wrong result.
